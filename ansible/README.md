# Ansible Directory

This directory will contain Ansible playbooks, inventory files, and configuration used to automate server setup and management.

## Planned Structure
- `hosts`: Inventory file with server details
- `site.yml`: Main playbook for full server provisioning
- `roles/`: Modular role-based tasks (e.g., docker, nginx, firewall)
- `group_vars/` and `host_vars/`: Variable definitions per group/host

## Status
Ansible setup will be added in a later step once the server is configured and SSH access is enabled.
