# Server Configs Directory

This directory holds configuration files, shell scripts, and templates related to the base setup and maintenance of the home server.

## Examples of Contents
- `fstab`, `hostname`, and network configs
- Firewall (ufw, iptables) and fail2ban configs
- Nginx, Docker, or Plex configuration templates
- Mount scripts or RAID setup scripts

This is meant to simulate managing real system configuration like a DevOps engineer.
