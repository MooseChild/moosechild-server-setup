# Configs Directory

This directory holds configuration files (YAML, INI, JSON, etc.) used by various services and tools on the home server.

These files will define settings for applications like Plex, Docker, Nginx, backup systems, and more.  
Each config file will be tracked in version control to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
